THE GAME OF GROW
Abstract strategy board game, with similarities to Go and Tron.
Intended for 3-4 players. Playable with 2+

MATERIALS
Board: 15x15 Go Board (each intersection is a "space")

Pieces: Light "head-stones" and dark "tail-stones" of a certain color
    (Player 1) Light red and dark red Go stones
    (Player 2) Light blue and dark blue Go stones
    (Player 3) Light green and dark green Go stones
    (Player 4) Light yellow and dark yellow Go stones

GAMEPLAY
Setup:
    1. Determine turn order. (Dice roll is suggested. Highest roll goes first. The person to the left/clockwise goes next)
    2. Each player, in order, puts a head-stone on any unoccupied space on the board.

On each following turn, until the board is filled:
    3. For each of the player's head-stones on the board:
        a. The player may move their head-stone to any adjacent space, unless it is occupied by another stone. (Diagonals are not allowed)
           OR
           If the head-stone is adjacent to a contiguous group of the player's own stones, the player may move their head-stone to any space in that group. (Multiple of the player's own stones may occupy the same space)
        b. If the space where the head-stone used to be is unoccupied, that players puts their own tail-stone in that space.
    4. The player may drop a head-stone onto any unoccupied space on the board.

Winning:
    5. When there are no more unoccupied spaces on the board, the game ends. The player with the most spaces occupied by their own stones wins.

TIPS
    - In the late game when you have a lot of head-stones, it can be hard to keep track of which stones have moved and which haven't. A good way to make sure you're moving all your stones is to move your head-stones in the top right of the board first, and work your way down to stones on the bottom right.

STRATEGIES
    - Encirclement: Completely surrounding a region of unoccupied spaces makes it easier for you to fill those spaces with your own stones later, because opponents' head-stones can't move into that region, so they must use their drop to invade the space. If the region is 1 stone wide, you can easily trap those stones by dropping your own stones on either side. Unlike your own stones, your opponents stones cannot escape that region under any circumstances.

    - Highway building: Since your head-stones can travel instantaneously along contiguous groups of your own stones it's adjacent to, using your stones to build long highways early on can give your head-stones life in the late game where it would otherwise be trapped. As long as the group has adjacent unoccupied spaces ("liberties" for you Go players), the head stones can travel next to the liberties on the highway, and move onto the liberties on your next turn. In the late game, this helps you fill in small, unoccupied spaces that are hard to reach without dropping a new stone. (These spaces resemble "dame" in a game of Go)
